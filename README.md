# rest-endpoints

library to help mapping ReST API endpoints


## Install

`pip install rest-endpoints`


## Usage

### Lets Map Urban Dictionary API

First step is creating a class responsible to handle how the credentials need
to injected on the HTTP requests

```python
from rest_endpoints import Credential


class ApiKeyCredential(Credential):
    headers = {
        "x-rapidapi-host": "mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com",
        "x-rapidapi-key": "SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY",
        "useQueryString": "true",
        }
```

Now lets map the class that will hold the shared domain and other data
(headers and query params) shared between endpoints

```python
from rest_endpoints import Endpoint


class CommunityUrbanDict(Endpoint):
    domain = "https://mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com"


class DefineEndpoint(CommunityUrbanDict):
    path = "/define"
```

For the sake of simplicity we will put all this together:


```python
from rest_endpoints import Credential
from rest_endpoints import Endpoint


class ApiKeyCredential(Credential):
    headers = {
        "x-rapidapi-host": "mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com",
        "x-rapidapi-key": "SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY",
        "useQueryString": "true",
        }


class CommunityUrbanDict(Endpoint):
    domain = "https://mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com"


class DefineEndpoint(CommunityUrbanDict):
    path = "/define"
```

Now we are going to use it to find the definition of _"wat"_:

```python
cred = ApiKeyCredential()
endpoint = DefineEndpoint(cred)
resp = endpoint.get(query_params={
    "term": "wat",
    })

# resp here is a Response object from requests module/library
print(resp.status_code)
print(resp.content)
```

Wrapping it all up

```python
from rest_endpoints import Credential
from rest_endpoints import Endpoint


class ApiKeyCredential(Credential):
    headers = {
        "x-rapidapi-host": "mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com",
        "x-rapidapi-key": "SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY",
        "useQueryString": "true",
        }


class CommunityUrbanDict(Endpoint):
    domain = "https://mashape-community-urban-dictionary.p.rapidapi.com"


class DefineEndpoint(CommunityUrbanDict):
    path = "/define"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cred = ApiKeyCredential()
    endpoint = DefineEndpoint(cred)
    resp = endpoint.get(query_params={
        "term": "wat",
        })

    # resp here is a Response object from requests module/library
    print(resp.status_code)
    print(resp.content)
```

We added a sample code for this scenario over the `examples/` folder
